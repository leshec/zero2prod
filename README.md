[![Rust](https://github.com/leshec/zero2prod/actions/workflows/general.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/leshec/zero2prod/actions/workflows/general.yml)

Do I want to? 
- Implement a faster lld/zld linker?  
- Look at the yml configs right now? I am. 

Tools
- [ ] postgress
- [ ] docker
- [ ] actix-web
- [ ] yaml up
- [ ] github actions
- [ ] re-read on modules syntax and visibility etc
- [ ] reflect on use of git comments. Look back and see.  

Recently
- [x] 3.5 implementing our first integration test
- [x] 3.5.1 polishing
- [x] 3.6 refocus
- [x] 3.7.2 capturing our requirements as test
- [x] 3.7.3 parsing form data from a POST request
- [x] 3.7.3.1 extractors - issue in progress
- [x] p58 create database (finally think i may have docker and postgres running
- [x] read ahead and around the crates and Actix more 
- [x] trying to get the db and docker started
- [x] make some start docker, db issues to remember and obsidian notes.
- [x] 3.8.5.2.2 reading a config / config management

Todo
- [ ] fix big clippy not happy in tests:
due to postgres failing as expected?
seems to be pissed at sqlx-cli, which i mistakenly added to toml.
it is a bin for command line, not a lib. tried fixing toml, tidying lock and target.
is it the github general yaml. as clippy, test, run etc fine for cargo on the command line.
check the general yaml config in github actions.
else finish sorted the query and see if that fixes.


- [ ] 3.8.5.3 connecting to postgress, p67

Bookmarks
- [ ] add bookmarks to jump back to here

Reading and research
- [ ] read up on github actions
- [ ] more read ahead and around the crates and Actix more 
- [ ] make my own notes to avoid headaches reproducing the docker, postgress, code interop
- [ ] step back at end 3.8 and make some notes

Notes:
- [ ] priority do some touring videos, reading on postgres
